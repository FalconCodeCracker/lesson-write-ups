Procedure:
Digital Signals and Technology:

I began by studying how digital signals are used to produce and distribute texts, music, and video. Digital signals are transmitted as binary data, which computers process to reproduce text, audio, and video. The distribution of these digital files occurs via various platforms such as streaming services and cloud storage.
I reviewed the challenges faced by individuals and companies in managing digital content, such as piracy, intellectual property rights, and the complexities of licensing.
Creative Commons Licenses:

I explored Creative Commons Licenses, which allow creators to share their work while maintaining certain rights. I learned about the different types of licenses available, such as Attribution, ShareAlike, NonCommercial, and NoDerivatives, and how they balance sharing and protecting the creator’s work.
I viewed the video "Creative Commons Licenses, Explained" to gain a deeper understanding of these licenses and how they support ethical sharing of content. This helps to foster a more open and ethical digital ecosystem.
Acceptable Use of Technology:

I reviewed the Acceptable Use of Technology Policy from AACC to understand the ethical guidelines surrounding the use of technology in academic and professional environments. This policy emphasizes the responsible use of technology, including avoiding misuse such as plagiarism, cyberbullying, and unauthorized access to information.
Managing Digital Reputation:

I explored the importance of respecting digital property and maintaining a positive digital reputation. This includes ethical considerations such as citing sources properly, respecting the privacy of others online, and avoiding actions that could damage one's reputation, like posting inappropriate content or engaging in harmful online behavior.
Lab Completion:

The instruction lab provided practice with these concepts by guiding me through the process of understanding and applying digital ethics. I followed the detailed instructions in Lab 14.0 to further explore how to manage digital content and maintain ethical behavior online.
Outcome:
By completing this lab, I gained a solid understanding of the ethical challenges that arise in the digital world, including intellectual property rights, Creative Commons licenses, and the responsible use of technology. I now understand how to manage digital content in a way that respects others’ work and protects my own digital reputation.

Conclusion:
This lab highlighted the importance of ethics in the digital age, particularly in terms of how we manage and distribute digital content. By following guidelines such as those set by Creative Commons and adhering to acceptable use policies, we can help create a responsible and respectful digital environment.

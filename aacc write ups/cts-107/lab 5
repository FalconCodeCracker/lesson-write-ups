Module 5: Lab 5.1 Write-Up
Objective:
The goal of this lab is to explore the differences between various types of software, including system software and application software. Additionally, the lab focuses on the installation, uninstallation, and upgrade processes of software, as well as understanding software licensing and methods for securely obtaining software.

Tools/Technologies:
Technology in Action textbook (Application Software chapter)
Software installation tools
Open-source software platforms
Procedure:
Reading and Research: I reviewed the assigned reading materials, which covered the types of software, their roles, and the distinctions between proprietary/commercial and open-source software. I learned about system software, such as operating systems, and application software, such as productivity and media tools.

Video Learning: I watched the video that provided a brief introduction to software. It explained the differences between system and application software and the various types of software licensing, including proprietary and open-source models.

Hands-on Practice: I completed the practice tasks outlined in Lab 5.0, which involved installing and uninstalling both proprietary and open-source software. I explored various software installation methods, including downloading and using package managers for open-source software.

Discussion Participation: I participated in the class discussion about the differences between proprietary/commercial and open-source software. I shared insights into the benefits and challenges of each type, particularly focusing on licensing and security.

Software Upgrades: I explored the software upgrade process, including how to check for updates, perform upgrades, and manage version control.

Code Explanation:
This lab did not involve coding but focused on practical skills in managing software. The hands-on tasks helped me understand how to install, uninstall, and upgrade software while considering security and licensing issues.

Challenges:
One challenge was understanding the various software licensing models. The distinctions between commercial licenses and open-source licenses took some time to fully grasp.

Outcome:
By completing this lab, I gained practical knowledge in installing, uninstalling, and upgrading software. I also learned about the different licensing options for proprietary and open-source software and how to securely obtain software.

Conclusion:
This lab reinforced the importance of understanding the types of software, their roles, and how to manage them effectively. The skills gained here are essential for managing software environments and ensuring security while working with both proprietary and open-source software.

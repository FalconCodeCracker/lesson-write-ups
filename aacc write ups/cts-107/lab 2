Module 2: Lab 2.1 Write-Up
Objective:
The purpose of this lab was to deepen understanding of the physical components of a computer system. This included exploring various hardware components, their functions, and how data is processed, stored, and output from computing devices.

Tools/Technologies:
Technology in Action textbook (Chapters 2 and 6)
Video on Binary & Data Flow in Computers
Resources on CPU, RAM, ROM, Storage, and Networking Devices
Video tutorial on installing a wireless NIC
Procedure:
Reading and Research: I started by reading Chapter 2, which covers the main functions of a computer system and how data flows through it. I also reviewed Chapter 6, which discussed hardware components and how to evaluate your system.

Video Learning: I watched the video explaining how computers work with binary data. This helped in understanding how computers process data using binary numbers. Additionally, I learned about how different storage options, such as RAM and ROM, are used for storing data.

Hands-on Practice: I completed Lab 2.0, which provided practice instructions for understanding and identifying various components of a computer system. The lab involved identifying types of input/output devices, examining the motherboard and RAM, and exploring different types of ports used in modern systems.

Discussion Participation: I joined the discussion on ergonomics, discussing the ideal physical setup for using computing devices to ensure comfort and prevent strain during long periods of use.

Lab Completion: Following the lab instructions, I gained hands-on experience in evaluating a computer system, including recognizing components like the CPU, RAM, and storage devices.

Code Explanation:
This lab didn’t require coding but focused on identifying and understanding the physical components of computer systems. The key takeaway was recognizing the relationships between the different parts of a computer and how they work together to process, store, and output data.

Challenges:
One of the more challenging aspects was understanding the intricate roles of each hardware component and how they work together in the overall system. It was also a bit tricky to fully grasp the power management options, especially when considering modern energy-efficient devices.

Outcome:
By completing this lab, I gained a solid understanding of how the different parts of a computer work together, including the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and input/output components. I now feel more confident in evaluating and understanding the hardware of a computer system.

Conclusion:
This lab reinforced my knowledge of the components inside a computer, and it helped me appreciate how these physical parts work together to allow a computer to function efficiently. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into system evaluation and understanding how to optimize performance in future labs.
